## Convert any PDF to an audiobook

Reading books is one of the best things one can do, but sometimes, we do not find time ebough to seat down and read. 
In this day and age of multitasking, we want to read books, but we don't often find enough time. 
This is a work in progress to convert any pdf book into an audiobook. 

Currently supports .pdf and .txt with the file being recognized by the extension of the file. 
On linux make sure that 'espeak' and 'ffmpeg' are installed - required to process the data
